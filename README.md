# Example scripts for AI assistants

Here you can find example scripts for AI assistants created with the <a href="https://alan.app/" target="_blank">Alan AI Platform</a>. Examine them to see how the dialog between the user and an AI assistant can be laid out and use them as a starting point to write your own dialog scripts.

For some of these examples, Alan AI provides sample projects in its Playground. Get the Alan AI Playground for <a href= "https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/alan-playground/id1474478921" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a href= "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.alan.playground" target="_blank">Android</a> and check out how conversational AI experiences can add value to your apps.
